## 3. Problem Statement  
Many people in India struggle with deciding what to cook based on the ingredients they have. Existing recipe apps often focus on Western cuisines, fail to understand local ingredient names in Hindi/regional languages, and don’t offer an AI-based personalized experience.  

## 4. Proposed Solution / Idea  
This project aims to make cooking easier and more exciting for Indian households by suggesting dishes popular in India (Indian or Indo-fusion cuisine) with clear step-by-step instructions, videos, and ingredient translations.
I will build an application that allows users to:  
- Enter available ingredients (in English or Hindi)  
- Get AI-generated suggestions for dishes that can be prepared using those ingredients  
- Provide clear step-by-step recipes and embedded video tutorials  
- Offer random recipe exploration for users who want to try new dishes without ingredient restrictions  
- Include authentication for personalized recommendations and saved favorite recipes

## 5. Key Features  
- **Ingredient-based recipe suggestions** (supports English & Hindi names for spices/ingredients)  
- **AI-powered personalized recommendations** based on cooking history and preferences  
- **Step-by-step instructions** + embedded video tutorials  
- **Random recipe exploration mode** for inspiration  
- **Secure user authentication** and profile system  
- **Favorites & Recently Cooked section** stored in user account

## 6. Target Users / Audience  
- Indian households and students living in hostels/PGs  
- Amateur and experienced home cooks  
- Food enthusiasts exploring Indo-fusion recipes

## 7. Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** React.js (Web), React Native (Mobile)  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** MongoDB / PostgreSQL  
- **AI/NLP:** OpenAI API / HuggingFace models for recipe matching & suggestions  
- **Translation:** Google Translate API or custom Hindi-English ingredient mapping  
- **Authentication:** Firebase Auth / JWT-based authentication

## 8. Expected Outcome  
A fully functional mobile & web app that:  
- Accurately understands both Hindi and English ingredient inputs  
- Suggests relevant, popular-in-India recipes  
- Displays cooking steps with clear instructions and video tutorials  
- Learns user preferences to improve suggestions over time

## 9. Timeline (8 Weeks)  
- **Week 1:** Research & UI/UX design  
- **Week 2:** Ingredient mapping (Hindi–English) & AI model selection  
- **Week 3:** Backend setup & database integration  
- **Week 4:** Ingredient-based recipe suggestion API  
- **Week 5:** Recipe details + video integration  
- **Week 6:** Authentication system & profile features  
- **Week 7:** AI personalization & random recipe mode  
- **Week 8:** Testing, bug fixes & deployment

## 10. Additional Notes  
- The recipe database will focus on dishes *popular in India*, including Indian regional cuisines and Indo-fusion (like Indo-Chinese, pasta, etc.).  
- Ingredient name mapping will be critical for matching Hindi inputs to database terms.  
- AI suggestions will improve over time using user history and preference learning.
